(Search online if needed.) Generally, integrated profiles only work with shells while external ones only work with terminal emulators.\n\n#### Examples\n\n__Shells__\n- Bash: `bash`\n- Bourne shell: `sh`\n- Command Prompt: `cmd`\n- Dash: `dash`\n- Git Bash: `<Git installation>\\bin\\bash.exe` (e.g. `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe`)\n- PowerShell Core: `pwsh`\n- Windows PowerShell: `powershell`\n- Windows Subsystem for Linux: `wsl` or `wsl -d <distribution name>`\n- Z shell: `zsh`\n\n__Terminal emulators__\n- Command Prompt: `cmd`\n- GNOME Terminal: `gnome-terminal`\n- Konsole: `konsole`\n- Terminal (macOS): `/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/macOS/Terminal \"$PWD\"`\n- Windows Terminal: `wt`\n- iTerm2: `/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 \"$PWD\"`\n- xterm: `xterm`\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nThis plugin patches `require` so that `require(\"obsidian\")` and other Obsidian modules work in the developer console. It is toggleable as `Expose internal modules` in settings.\n\nIn the developer console, a context variable `$$` is passed into the code, which can be used to dynamically change terminal options.\n\nThe full API is available from [`sources/@types/obsidian-terminal.ts`](sources/%40types/obsidian-terminal.ts).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!\n\n### Todos\n\nThe todos here, ordered alphabetically, are things planned for the plugin. There are no guarantees that they will be completed. However, we are likely to accept contributions for them.\n\n- Connect to remote shells.\n- Copy terminal tabs.\n- Create ad-hoc profile in `Open terminal: Select`.\n- Detect sandboxed environment and notify users.\n- Edit profile before opening terminal in `Open terminal: Select` when a modifier key is pressed.\n- External link confirmation.\n- Filter console log by severity in the developer console.\n- Fix broken section links in builtin documentations.\n- Indicate that the terminal resizer has crashed or is disabled.\n- Shared terminal tabs.\n- Vim mode switch.\n\n### Translating\n\nTranslation files are under [`assets/locales/`](assets/locales/). Each locale has its own directory named with its corresponding __[IETF language tag](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag)__. Some translation keys are missing here and instead located at [`obsidian-plugin-library`][plugin library].\n\nTo contribute translation for an existing locale, modify the files in the corresponding directory.\n\nFor a new locale, create a new directory named with its language tag and copy [`assets/locales/en/translation.json`](assets/locales/en/translation.json) into it. Then, add an entry to [`assets/locales/en/language.json`](assets/locales/en/language.json) in this format:\n```JSONc\n{\n\t// ...\n\t\"en\": \"English\",\n\t\"(your-language-tag)\": \"(Native name of your language)\",\n\t\"uwu\": \"Uwuish\",\n\t// ...\n}\n```\nSort the list of languages by the alphabetical order of their language tags. Then modify the files in the new directory. There will be errors in [`assets/locales.ts`](assets/locales.ts), which you can ignore and we will fix them for you. You are welcome to fix them yourself if you know TypeScript.\n\nWhen translating, keep in mind the following things:\n- Do not translate anything between `{{` and `}}` (`{{example}}`). They are __interpolations__ and will be replaced by localized strings at runtime.\n- Do not translate anything between `$t(` and `)` (`$t(example)`). They refer to other localized strings. To find the localized string being referred to, follow the path of the key, which is separated by dots (`.`). For example, the key [`youtu.be./dQw4w9WgXcQ`](https://youtu.be./dQw4w9WgXcQ) refers to:\n```JSONc\n{\n\t// ...\n\t\"youtu\": {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\t\"be\": {\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t\"/dQw4w9WgXcQ\": \"I am 'youtu.be./dQw4w9WgXcQ'!\",\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t},\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n\t// ...\n}\n```\n- The keys under `generic` are vocabularies. They can be referred in translation strings by `$t(generic.key)`. Refer to them as much as possible to standardize translations for vocabularies that appear in different places.\n- It is okay to move interpolations and references to other localized strings around to make the translation natural. It is also okay to not use some references used in the original translation. However, it is NOT okay to not use all interpolations.\n\n## Security\n\nWe hope that there will never be any security vulnerabilities, but unfortunately it does happen. Please [report](#reporting-a-vulnerability) them!\n\n### Supported versions\n\n| Version | Supported |\n|-|-|\n| latest | ✅ |\n| outdated | ❌ |\n\n### Reporting a vulnerability\n\nPlease report a vulerability by opening an new issue. We will get back to you as soon as possible.\n",
