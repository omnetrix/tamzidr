# Hi, I'm Tamzid. I'm a student based in the Netherlands. ᕦʕ •`ᴥ•´ʔᕤ

## On this website I share my projects, and insights I have gained over the years.

### It's mostly about psychology, philosophy and coding. I am hoping to learn more together with you along the way. Please feel free to take a look around.
