Hi! I am Tamzid, a student based in the Netherlands. With me naturally enjoying thinking, I decided to create this site to connect with people who share the same curiosities as mine. Living life can become a mess and can result in circumstances you never expected. I want to share my insights on Psychology, Mental Health, Philosophy, and more so that we become stronger together.

I grew up around computers and saw each time I booted up my PC as an adventure. This experience made me more conscious of the world around me and may have resulted in my thoughts taking the same scale. A large part of my childhood was also spent enjoying cartoons on "Cartoon Network." Some of my favorites were; "Ben 10", "Scooby-Doo," "Regular Show, "Adventure Time," and "The Amazing World of Gumball." I loved playing with Knex, exploring my area by bike, and playing lots of flash games. Later in my childhood, I started a YouTube Channel. I learned a lot about video editing, photoshop, filming, and much more. Once I took off, I gained a kind of popularity around my area. I wish I could show you guys my content because it showed who I was at the time, but unfortunately, I deleted my videos a few years later. I still regret doing that, but we move.

Nowadays, I am far more focused on maturing as a person. I like to read non-fiction and watch a lot of content on topics like; Philosophy, Psychology/Mental health, Art & Business. I dedicate time to trying to improve and know myself better. I truly believe that, especially if you have lots of opportunities, your surroundings are based on what you are; your DNA, Psychology, and Philosophy all dictate where you go in life. That's why I'm very obsessed with these topics because these small changes make big effects long term.

Which brings me back to you, my goal is to shape myself into a stronger me and bring you together with me on this journey. I'm putting lots of effort into this, and I want to share my fruits with you. This world can be a hard one to navigate.
