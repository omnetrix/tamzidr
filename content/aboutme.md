Hello! I'm Tamzid, a student based in the Netherlands.

## My Journey with Technology and Creativity

I grew up around computers and saw each time I booted up my PC as an adventure. This experience made me more conscious of the world around me. A large part of my childhood was also spent enjoying cartoons on "Cartoon Network." Some of my favorites were; "Ben 10", "Scooby-Doo," "Regular Show, "Adventure Time," and "The Amazing World of Gumball." I loved playing with Knex, exploring my area by bike, and playing lots of flash games. Later in my childhood, I started a YouTube Channel. I learned a lot about video editing, photoshop, filming, and much more. Once I took off, I gained a kind of popularity around my area. I wish I could show you guys my content because it showed who I was at the time, but unfortunately, I deleted my videos a few years later. I still regret doing that, but we move.

## Nowadays,

Nowadays, In addition to computers and art, I am also more focused on maturing as a person and understanding the world. I like to read non-fiction/fiction and watch a lot of content on topics like; Philosophy, Psychology/Mental health, Art & Business. I truly believe that that these small changes in life make big effects long term.

## Why I created this website

I've decided to create this site, so I can share many of my coding projects, experiences, insights.. really just anything interesting I have learned. I hope we can make this a space, where we can both have fun, learn from each other and follow our natural curiosities. Please enjoy your stay.
