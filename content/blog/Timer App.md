title: My First JavaScript Project!

HI. I made my first javascript project, and it was a simple timer with an alarm sound.
Feel free to give it a try at https://nordtimer.pages.dev/ .

It was very fun making it, and I got lots of experience with dealing with bugs.
One prevelant bug was that the sound wasn't working on all webbrowsers/devices, and I got that fixed by using an HTML element, instead of javascript for the audio. I learned that fixing something doesn't have to be using the same thing, but fixed, but can also mean replacing something. But this also strikes the question of, have I learned something from the issue? I mean I do believe all code has a logical explanation for each error. It was quite hard for me to find it with the javascript code, and my goal of making the was more of priority than getting stuck on this one issue.

Let me know your thoughts.
