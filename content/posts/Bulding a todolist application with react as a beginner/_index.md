Hi! Welcome to one my first real posts, in this particular post I will mark my progress as a react developer whilst building a todolist application.

## My goals for this project are

- Using real thinking and problem solving without relying too much on tutorials 
- Using more of the documentation
- Understanding how complex applications work
- Looking through the lens of a designer and coder, by building mockups, collecting ideas.. etc.

## My vision

I have as goal to create something similar to the [TeuxDeux](https://teuxdeux.com/home) application. I want to try to market my product as an easy to pickup, and stress free solution compared to other todolist applications. I want to envoke a feeling, as that of writing something on a paper and being able to throw it in the bin without much thinking. The todolist should be a tool, not an hindrance.

This is what I brainstormed so far in Figma and Obsidian (canvas) :

Please note that this is just a simple overview of how I want it to function for now, it may very well be that the complexity of the project will increase as it progresses.

I've found a name I really like using namelix (no pormo) . I simply wrote the keywords I already had in figma, and something great came out. "Focuspaper" really encaptures what I'm going for. I really want to create mockups and design the branding, but I musn't forget I am trying to learn to code here. I look forward to sharing those later though.
