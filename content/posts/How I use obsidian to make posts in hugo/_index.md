When starting to work with Hugo you are presented with an, in my opinion ugly way to type out your posts. It is in markdown, and often simply written in your IDE. Obsidian serves as an unconventional solution to this problem.. 
## Step 1: Create a Hugo site

_CHATGPT_
1. **Install Hugo**: Download and install Hugo for your operating system from [Hugo's website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
2. **Create a New Hugo Site**: Open your terminal or command prompt. Run this command to create a new Hugo site: `hugo new site your-site-name`. Replace `your-site-name` with your desired site name.
3. **Choose a Theme (Optional)**: If you want a pre-designed look for your site, pick a theme from [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Install a theme by running: `git clone https://github.com/theme-name.git themes/theme-name`.
4. **Configure Your Site**: Edit the `config.toml` file in your site's root directory to set the site title and other options.
5. **Create Content**: Create new content (e.g., blog posts) using this command: `hugo new path/to/content-file.md Replace `path/to/content-file.md` with your desired file path and name.
6. - **Edit Content**: Open the newly created `.md` file and write your content in Markdown.
7. **Preview Your Site**: Run this command to see your site locally: `hugo server -D` Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:1313` to view your site.
8. **Build Your Site**: When ready to publish, generate static files with: `hugo` Your site will be in the `public` folder.
9. **Deploy Your Site**: Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages) and follow their deployment instructions.

That's it! You've created a simple Hugo site, customised it, and can publish it online.
## Step 2:  Download obsidian

This is self explanatory, you can simply download obsidian from their official website using your respective platform. Here is a link https://obsidian.md/download ;)
## Step 3: Open your site as an obsidian vault
