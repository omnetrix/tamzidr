  <p>Hi! I am Tamzid, a student based in the Netherlands. With me naturally enjoying thinking, I decided to create this site to connect with people who share the same curiosities as mine. Living life can become a mess and can result in circumstances you never expected. I want to share my insights on Psychology, Mental Health, Philosophy, and more so that we become stronger together.</p>
<p>I grew up around computers and saw each time I booted up my PC as an adventure. This experience made me more conscious of the world around me and may have resulted in my thoughts taking the same scale. A large part of my childhood was also spent enjoying cartoons on &ldquo;Cartoon Network.&rdquo; Some of my favorites were; &ldquo;Ben 10&rdquo;, &ldquo;Scooby-Doo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Regular Show, &ldquo;Adventure Time,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Amazing World of Gumball.&rdquo; I loved playing with Knex, exploring my area by bike, and playing lots of flash games. Later in my childhood, I started a YouTube Channel. I learned a lot about video editing, photoshop, filming, and much more. Once I took off, I gained a kind of popularity around my area. I wish I could show you guys my content because it showed who I was at the time, but unfortunately, I deleted my videos a few years later. I still regret doing that, but we move.</p>
<img src="/images/meinthesnow.jpeg" alt="Me in the snow" style="max-width: 400px;">

<p>Nowadays, I am far more focused on maturing as a person. I like to read non-fiction and watch a lot of content on topics like; Philosophy, Psychology/Mental health, Art &amp; Business. I dedicate time to trying to improve and know myself better. I truly believe that, especially if you have lots of opportunities, your surroundings are based on what you are; your DNA, Psychology, and Philosophy all dictate where you go in life. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m very obsessed with these topics because these small changes make big effects long term.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to you, my goal is to shape myself into a stronger me and bring you together with me on this journey. I&rsquo;m putting lots of effort into this, and I want to share my fruits with you. This world can be a hard one to navigate. By subscribing to my newsletter, you can gain something for your mind to chew on and get access to weekly practical articles on everything I described. I am committed to bringing the best of the best each week directly to your inbox. Of course, this is all free of charge.</p>
<p>Together, let&rsquo;s live life whilst, gaining a deeper understanding of ourselves, the world around us, and forge a path toward a satisfactory life. Don&rsquo;t miss out on this opportunity. Subscribe now and join our community of fellow curious minds.</p>
