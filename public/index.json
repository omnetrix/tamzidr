Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick guide on how to do just that.\nNavigate to the Local Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you\u0026rsquo;ve cloned the repository using the cd command. For example:\ncd path/to/your/cloned/repository Make Changes: Now that you\u0026rsquo;re in the repository directory, make the desired changes to the files using your preferred text editor or IDE.\nAdd Changes: After making your changes, you need to stage them for commit using the git add command. You can add all changes at once by running:\ngit add . This command adds all modified and new files to the staging area.\nCommit Changes: Once your changes are staged, commit them to the local repository using the git commit command with a descriptive message:\ngit commit -m \u0026#34;Your descriptive commit message here\u0026#34; Replace \u0026quot;Your descriptive commit message here\u0026quot; with a brief but informative description of the changes you\u0026rsquo;ve made.\nSync Changes to GitHub: Finally, you need to push your committed changes to the remote GitHub repository using the git push command:\ngit push origin master This command pushes your changes from the local master branch to the origin remote repository, which is typically GitHub.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! Your changes should now be synced to the remote GitHub repository.\n","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1711834333510-new-article/","section":"Posts","summary":"So, you\u0026rsquo;ve cloned a repository from GitHub to your local machine, and now you want to make changes and sync them back to the remote repository?","title":"How to sync cloned GitHub repositories","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"tamzidr.com","summary":"","title":"tamzidr.com","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
