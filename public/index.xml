      <description>Hi! I am Tamzid, a student based in the Netherlands. With me naturally enjoying thinking, I decided to create this site to connect with people who share the same curiosities as mine. Living life can become a mess and can result in circumstances you never expected. I want to share my insights on Psychology, Mental Health, Philosophy, and more so that we become stronger together.
I grew up around computers and saw each time I booted up my PC as an adventure.</description>
